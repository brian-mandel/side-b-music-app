# Side B

Side B is a social music rating and discovery app designed to encourage thoughtful, non-toxic takes on albums and artists. Think Letterboxd for music, but optimized for constructive engagement and future AI-powered recommendations.

## Live Demo

## What It Does

- Rate albums
- Browse a social feed of recent activity
- Track favorite records
- Explore trending music
- Structured rating system to reduce low-effort hot takes

## Why I Built This

Music discovery platforms tend to optimize for volume and virality rather than quality of engagement. I wanted to explore what a music community might look like if it rewarded structured, thoughtful interaction instead of low-effort hot takes.

Side B is an experiment in product mechanics: how ratings, feeds, and discovery systems can be designed to encourage signal over noise. It also serves as a foundation for layering AI-driven recommendations on top of explicit user preferences rather than opaque algorithmic guesses.

This project reflects my broader interest in building products that combine structured user input, social mechanics, and intelligent recommendation systems.
